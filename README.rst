DNS firewall
============

A proxy to inspect and mingle locally generated DNS queries.
Optional tray icon an Gtk interface.

Rationale 
--------- 
 
Inspecting and filtering DNS traffic generated by desktop applications can be tricky. 
Tools like tcpdump have no way to tell which running process generated a DNS query. 
Also, Netfilter cannot filter traffic by domain name and many domains resolve to IP addresses that change frequently. 
  
A typical use case is to monitor browser, browsers plugins and extensions for suspicious home-calling or malicious/tracking javascript, or other application leaking data through DNS queries. 
 
dns-firewall acts as a forwarding DNS resolver. It listens locally on port 53 and forwards only the allowed queries to external resolvers. 

It detects the name of the process trying to resolve a domain name and applies filtering rules based on that. 

Features
--------

* Block DNS queries by application and domain, or return configurable IP addresses
* Tray icon with activity indicators
* Log window to inspect recent activity
* Optionally resolve names using the Tor network

Usage
-----

Create ~/.config/dns-firewall/conf.yaml from conf.yaml.example

Binding to UDP port 53 is required. You can run the process as root or install
and configure authbind::

   sudo apt-get install authbind
   sudo touch /etc/authbind/byport/53
   authbind --depth 2 dns-firewall

   # or

   sudo dns-firewall

Add --tray to enable the tray icon and Gtk interface. Left-click on the tray icon to display the log window.

Update your /etc/resolv.conf with "nameserver 127.0.0.1"
