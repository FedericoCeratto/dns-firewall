# Like in netfilter, the rules are processed in sequence until a match is found.
# The default values are:
#
#   action: drop        # Can be accept, nxdomain, return, drop
#   dnscrypt: false     # Use DNSCrypt
#   processname: *      # Match process name
#   tcp: false          # Use TCP instead of UDP
#   tor: false          # Resolve over Tor
#   username: *         # Match username
#   warn: false         # Log match
#   zone: *             # Match zone
